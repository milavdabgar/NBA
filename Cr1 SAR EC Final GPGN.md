Process for Defining PEOs of the Department

![Image](Cr1 SAR EC Final GPGN_artifacts/image_000014_148adc259baad4a0de9ee377ac1381152b7ab8c4a633d6a39016da925515ab26.png)

## PEO-Definition:

Broad long-term career goals that  describe  what  diploma  pass  out  students  are  expected  to achieve 3-5 years after completing the program.

Focus:

## Professional achievement, lifelong learning, societal contribution, and ethical practice.

## Audience:

Intended for diploma pass outs after they enter the workforce or pursue higher studies.

The image depicts a flowchart illustrating the process of developing and refining a department's vision and mission within an educational institution. This process involves multiple stakeholders and follows a structured approach. Here's a detailed description of the process shown:

## 1. Institute Vision and Mission:

The process begins with the overarching vision and mission of the institute. This serves as the foundation and guiding principle for all subsequent steps.

## 2. Department Vision and Mission:

Building  on  the  institute's  vision  and  mission,  a  preliminary  department-specific  vision  and mission  is  formulated.  This  step  ensures  alignment  between  the  department's  goals  and  the broader institutional objectives.

## 3. Stakeholders' View:

This  is  a  crucial  phase  where  input  is  gathered  from  various  stakeholders.  The  stakeholders included in this process are:

- ⮚ Alumni: Former students who can provide perspectives based on their experiences.
- ⮚ Parents &amp; Students: Current students and their parents, offering insights into expectations and experiences.
- ⮚ Employers: Organizations that hire graduates, providing industry perspectives and requirements.
- ⮚ Faculty Members: Academic staff who are integral to implementing the vision and mission.
- ⮚ Students:  Current  students  who  are  directly  affected  by  the  department's  policies  and direction.

These stakeholders contribute their views, likely through surveys, meetings, or other feedback mechanisms. Their diverse perspectives ensure a comprehensive understanding of the department's role and impact.

4. Summarize and Analyse Views:

After collecting input from all stakeholders, the next step involves consolidating and analyzing the gathered information. This likely includes identifying common themes, priorities, and areas of concern across different stakeholder groups.

## 5. Accept:

Based on the analysis of stakeholder views, the department leadership makes decisions on what aspects  to  incorporate  into  the  vision  and  mission.  This  step  may  involve  discussions  and refinements to ensure the final version adequately reflects stakeholder input while aligning with institutional goals.

6. PEOs (Program Educational Objectives):

The final step in this process is the formulation of Program Educational Objectives. These are specific,  measurable  goals  that  the  department  sets  for  its  educational  programs,  directly informed by the newly refined vision and mission.

This  systematic  approach  ensures  that  the  department's  vision,  mission,  and  educational objectives  are  not  created  in  isolation  but  are  instead  the  result  of  a  collaborative  effort  that considers multiple perspectives. It demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and responsiveness to the needs and expectations of various groups connected to the department and institution.

## 1.5 Establish consistency of PEOs with Mission of the Department

The PEOs ensure the accomplishments of the mission of the Department with special emphasis on technical competence of engineers, value addition, and sustainable solutions to engineering problems. For the mapping of PEOs and Mission, several meetings of the faculty members were conducted  at  department  level.  The  feedback  of  the  faculty  members  was  taken  into consideration and the mapping was finalized as below.

The Vision, Mission and PEOs were also finalized based on the following components:

- ⮚ Departmental meeting
- ⮚ Feedback from industries
- ⮚ Feedback from students/ alumni
- ⮚ Feedback from training and placement department
- ⮚ Parents meet

| PEO   | Mission   |   Mapping Level | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PEO1  | M1        |               3 | This is strongly aligned (level 3) because both the PEO  and M1 focus on developing proficiency in electronics  and  communication engineering to serve industry  and  society.                                |
| PEO1  | M2        |               1 | The weak alignment (level 1) is due to M2's focus on  ethical values, which is not explicitly mentioned in PEO  1.                                                                                             |
| PEO1  | M3        |               2 | There's  a  moderate  alignment  (level  2)  as  effective  teaching  and  faculty  development  indirectly  support  students' ability to apply knowledge and skills.                                         |
| PEO2  | M1        |               2 | There's moderate alignment (level 2) as serving industry  and  society  relates  to  contributing  to  communities,  though ethics aren't explicitly mentioned in M1.                                          |
| PEO2  | M2        |               3 | This is strongly aligned (level 3) due to the direct focus  on ethical values in both PEO 2 and M2.                                                                                                            |
| PEO2  | M3        |               1 | The  weak  alignment  (level  1)  is  because  faculty  development doesn't directly address ethical principles  or community contribution.                                                                    |
| PEO3  | M1        |               3 | There is a strong alignment (level 3) as proficiency in  the field directly supports adaptability to advancements,  though lifelong learning.                                                                  |
| PEO3  | M2        |               2 | The  moderate  alignment  (level  2)  comes  from  the  contributory  approach  in  M2,  which  relates  to  professional  development,  though  it  doesn't  directly  address technological adaptation.      |
| PEO3  | M3        |               2 | This  also  has  moderate  alignment  (level  2)  because  continuous faculty development indirectly supports the  concept of lifelong learning, though it doesn't explicitly  address students' adaptability. |
