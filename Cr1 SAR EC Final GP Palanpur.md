## 1.5 Establish consistency of PEOs with Mission of the Department

### A. Preparation of a matrix of PEOs and elements of Mission statement (Levels: 1=Slight, 2=Moderate, 3=Substantial)

| PEO  | Mission | Mapping | Rationale (concise) |
|------|---------|--------:|---------------------|
| PEO1 | M1      | 3       | Quality EC education drives professional success and innovation. |
| PEO1 | M2      | 2       | Infra/faculty upgradation supports hands-on skills for careers. |
| PEO1 | M3      | 3       | Industry liaison fosters employability, innovation, entrepreneurship. |
| PEO1 | M4      | 2       | Activities nurture innovation/entrepreneurial mindset. |
| PEO2 | M1      | 2       | Strong fundamentals enable higher studies. |
| PEO2 | M2      | 2       | Advanced labs/classrooms facilitate academic progression. |
| PEO2 | M3      | 1       | Industry links offer exposure but are secondary for higher study. |
| PEO2 | M4      | 1       | Co/extra activities complement, not core to higher study. |
| PEO3 | M1      | 2       | Curriculum integrates professional ethics and societal context. |
| PEO3 | M2      | 1       | Infra/faculty indirectly support ethics awareness. |
| PEO3 | M3      | 2       | Industry liaison surfaces societal/ethical practice scenarios. |
| PEO3 | M4      | 3       | Activities explicitly inculcate values and responsibility. |
| PEO4 | M1      | 2       | Curriculum updates expose students to emerging technologies. |
| PEO4 | M2      | 3       | Upgraded infra/faculty enable adaptation to technological change. |
| PEO4 | M3      | 2       | Industry engagement highlights trends and sustainability needs. |
| PEO4 | M4      | 2       | Activities sensitize to environmental/societal issues. |

### B. Consistency/justification of co-relation parameters of the above matrix

- PEO1 aligns strongly with M1 and M3 (employability and innovation focus), moderately with M2 and M4.
- PEO2 aligns moderately with M1 and M2 (foundation and facilities), slightly with M3/M4.
- PEO3 aligns strongly with M4 (values), moderately with M1/M3, slightly with M2.
- PEO4 aligns strongly with M2 (upgradation), moderately with M1/M3/M4.

1. Slight (Low) 2. Moderate (Medium) 3. Substantial (High)
