# Repository Overview

This repository contains document-centric materials (Markdown, PDFs, and media) and their related artifacts used for reporting and accreditation workflows.

- Key directories: `portalDoc/`, `SAR EC Final GPGN_artifacts/`, `New2016_17/`.
- Primary docs live at the root (e.g., `SAR EC Final GPGN.md`). Place supporting media next to the doc or in a nearby `..._artifacts/` folder.

## Contributing
- Start with `AGENTS.md` for structure, naming, and workflow guidelines.
- Preview Markdown locally (editor or `open <file>.md` on macOS) and verify relative links/images.
- Use `rg "keyword" -n` to search across documents.

## Getting Help
If something is unclear or you need exceptions (large binaries, renames, or reorganizations), open a PR or issue describing the proposed change and rationale.
