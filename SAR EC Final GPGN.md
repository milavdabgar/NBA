| PEO1  | M1        |               3 | This is strongly aligned (level 3) because both the PEO  and M1 focus on developing proficiency in electronics  and  communication engineering to serve industry  and  society.                                |
| PEO1  | M2        |               1 | The weak alignment (level 1) is due to M2's focus on  ethical values, which is not explicitly mentioned in PEO  1.                                                                                             |
| PEO1  | M3        |               2 | There's  a  moderate  alignment  (level  2)  as  effective  teaching  and  faculty  development  indirectly  support  students' ability to apply knowledge and skills.                                         |
| PEO2  | M1        |               2 | There's moderate alignment (level 2) as serving industry  and  society  relates  to  contributing  to  communities,  though ethics aren't explicitly mentioned in M1.                                          |
| PEO2  | M2        |               3 | This is strongly aligned (level 3) due to the direct focus  on ethical values in both PEO 2 and M2.                                                                                                            |
| PEO2  | M3        |               1 | The  weak  alignment  (level  1)  is  because  faculty  development doesn't directly address ethical principles  or community contribution.                                                                    |
| PEO3  | M1        |               3 | There is a strong alignment (level 3) as proficiency in  the field directly supports adaptability to advancements,  though lifelong learning.                                                                  |
| PEO3  | M2        |               2 | The  moderate  alignment  (level  2)  comes  from  the  contributory  approach  in  M2,  which  relates  to  professional  development,  though  it  doesn't  directly  address technological adaptation.      |
| PEO3  | M3        |               2 | This  also  has  moderate  alignment  (level  2)  because  continuous faculty development indirectly supports the  concept of lifelong learning, though it doesn't explicitly  address students' adaptability. |

## Identification of Compliance of curriculum for attaining POs and PSOs

The process of mapping of course outcome with POs and PSOs for each course is described in Criterion3 in detail with justification.

## Program Articulation Matrix

The Program Articulation Matrix (PAM) is an essential academic tool in Outcome-Based Education (OBE), primarily utilized to systematically map the relationship between Course Outcomes (COs) and Program Outcomes (POs) as well as Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) in an educational program.

Under the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) framework, the emphasis is on ensuring that the courses taught within a program contribute effectively to the achievement of clearly defined program outcomes. The PAM provides a structured visual representation of this alignment. It ensures that each course's intended learning outcomes (COs) meaningfully contribute to the overall diploma attributes specified by POs and PSOs.

The Program Articulation Matrix (PAM) is a powerful tool for:

-  Ensuring systematic curriculum-outcome alignment
-  Identifying areas of improvement within the curriculum
-  Addressing curricular gaps through targeted interventions
-  Providing evidence of outcome-based education implementation to NBA
-  Supporting continuous improvement for educational quality assurance

The program articulation matrix indicates the extent each course helps to attain program outcomes.

## Process for Finding Curricular Gaps:

The Entire Process of Finding Curricular Gaps Focuses On (Through Program Articulation Matrix): The basic steps for gap analysis include:

## 1. Mapping Outcomes through PAM:

-  The Program Assessment Matrix (PAM) serves as a critical tool to systematically link Course Outcomes (COs) to Program Outcomes (POs) and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs).
-  Each course offered in the curriculum is analyzed for its contribution to the attainment of POs and PSOs.
-  The strength of mapping is usually quantified using levels (e.g., 1 - low, 2 - moderate, 3 high), showing how strongly each course outcome supports specific program outcomes.
-  This mapping provides a consolidated overview of how well the curriculum aligns with the intended program-level educational objectives.

## 2. Identifying Gaps:

-  Once the PAM is developed, gap identification involves a detailed analysis of the distribution and strength of mappings across all CO-PO and CO-PSO relationships.
-  Gaps are identified when:
-  Certain POs or PSOs are not addressed or are mapped at a very low level (e.g., Level 0 or 1) across the entire program.
-  Some  outcomes  are  underrepresented  or  overly  dependent  on  a  limited  number  of courses.
-  There is imbalanced mapping, where some POs are addressed excessively while others are neglected.
-  It  ensures  that  the  curriculum's contribution to program  goals is comprehensive and evenly distributed, without over-reliance on a few courses.

## 3. Addressing the Identified Gaps:

-  The insights derived from PAM directly inform stakeholders to take corrective actions.
-  This may include updating syllabi, or organizing seminar, workshops, expert lectures, industrial visit where specific POs/PSOs are lacking.

## Flowchart of Process for finding curricular gaps

## Step 1: Define Program Outcomes (POs) (Defined by NBA)

Program  Outcomes  (POs)  are  specific  competencies  that  students  are  expected  to  achieve  upon completion of diploma. These are derived from the NBA. Clearly defining POs helps in aligning course objectives with broader educational expectations and ensures uniformity in curriculum planning and delivery.

## Step 2: Develop PAM by mapping each Course Outcome (CO) to relevant POs and PSOs using levels (1 = Low, 2 = Moderate, 3 = High)

The Program Articulation Matrix (PAM) is a structured tool where each Course Outcome (CO) is mapped against Program Outcomes (POs) and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs). The mapping is based on the extent to which a course supports each outcome:

-  Level 1 : Low contribution
-  Level 2 : Moderate contribution
-  Level 3 : High contribution

## Step 3: Calculate the average mapping score for each PO and PSO across all courses

Once the matrix is filled, calculate the average score for each PO and PSO by aggregating the mapping levels across all relevant courses. This score gives an overall view of how strongly the curriculum supports each outcome and helps quantify program effectiveness.

## Step 4: Compare each average value against a predefined threshold (2.00)

A benchmark or threshold (commonly set at 2.00 ) is used to assess adequacy. Each PO and PSO's average score is compared to this threshold:

-  If the average is ≥ 2.00 , the outcome is considered adequately addressed.
-  If it is &lt; 2.00 , there is a shortfall that must be investigated.

This numerical comparison adds objectivity to the evaluation process.

## Step 5: Identify any PO/PSO with average &lt; 2.00 as a GAP area

Any Program Outcome or Program Specific Outcome with an average score below the threshold is flagged as a curricular gap . These gaps indicate that students may not be adequately achieving certain competencies or skills and highlight areas in need of academic attention.

## Step 6: Analyse reasons for low value of mapping and suggest corrective measures

Conduct a root cause analysis to identify why certain POs/PSOs are underachieved. Possible reasons may include:

-  Insufficient course content addressing that PO/PSO
-  Lack of practical exposure or contextual learning
-  Misalignment of assessments with intended outcomes.
-  Based  on  the  analysis,  formulate  actionable  recommendations  to  address  the  root causes.

## Step 7: Update curriculum and organise activities to bridge gaps.

Based on the identified gaps and their causes, implement curriculum changes such as:

-  Organising expert lecture, workshops, seminars, industrial visit to fill the gap
-  Introducing interdisciplinary learning
-  Updating curriculum

This step is crucial for closing the loop in the Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) process.

Based on the provided Program Articulation Matrix, the curricular gaps can be identified as below:

| Program  Outcome                                                             |   Average  Mapping | Gap  Identified   | Appropriateness of the Gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PO2  -  Problem  Analysis                                                    |               1.88 | Yes               | The average mapping score for PO2 is below the 2.00  threshold,  indicating  insufficient  development  of  students'  analytical  skills  for  engineering  problems.  This  gap  suggests  that  the  curriculum  may  lack  structured  problem-solving  exercises  or  application- based case studies. Addressing this will ensure students  can  effectively  identify  and  analyze  technical  challenges using standard methods. |
| PO3-  Design/Dev elopment of  Solutions                                      |               1.91 | Yes               | With an average below 2.00, PO3 shows students are  not gaining adequate experience in developing design  solutions. This may result from limited design-centric  assignments  or  lack  of  interdisciplinary  projects.  Bridging  this  gap  can  enhance  innovation,  creativity,  and solution-based learning among students.                                                                                                       |
| PO5- Engineerin g  practices  for  Society,  Environme nt  and  Sustainabili |               1.69 | Yes               | This  gap  reflects  a  low  emphasis  on  integrating  environmental,  ethical,  and  societal  aspects  into  the  curriculum. A 1.69 average mapping indicates students  may not  fully  understand  the  societal  implications  of  technology. Strengthening this PO prepares students to  be socially responsible engineers.                                                                                                       |
| PO6- Project  Manageme nt                                                    |               1.71 | Yes               | The score for PO6 confirms that students have limited  opportunities  to  practice  management  principles  in  projects. This includes leadership, communication, and  resource  planning  skills,  which  are  crucial  for  engineering  practice.  This  gap  supports  the  need  for  structured  project-based  learning  and  management  workshops.                                                                              |
| PO7-Life- long  Learning                                                     |               1.95 | Yes               | A score of 1.95 highlights the need to promote student  autonomy  in  learning  and  staying  updated  with  technological trends. This gap is appropriate as current  pedagogy may not sufficiently foster continuous, self- driven  learning  habits.  Addressing  it  can  help  build  adaptability and resilience in professional life.                                                                                              |

Table 2.1.1.12. Curricular Gaps from Program Articulation Matrix for the Batch Admitted in 2021 and onwards

The process of finding curricular gaps from the Program Articulation Matrix is crucial for meeting NBA accreditation criteria 2.1.2, which focuses on the attainment of Program Outcomes and Program Specific Outcomes.

## Justification of the process to find curricular gap:

1. Threshold Selection: The threshold of 2 for average attainment is chosen based on the common practice in outcome-based education. On a scale typically ranging from 1 to 3, a value of 2 represents satisfactory accomplishment. Anything below this indicates a need for improvement.
2. Comprehensive Evaluation: By calculating the average mapping for each PO and PSO across all courses, we get a holistic view of how well the curriculum is addressing each outcome.
3. Objective Identification of Gaps: Comparing each average mapping to the threshold provides an objective method to identify areas where the curriculum may be falling short. This removes subjectivity from the process.
4. Alignment with NBA Requirements: NBA criteria 2.1.2 specifically asks for the identification of curricular gaps concerning the attainment of POs and PSOs. This process directly addresses this requirement.
5. Basis for Improvement: Identifying these gaps provides a clear starting point for curriculum enhancement. It allows the institution to focus its efforts on the most critical areas needing improvement.
6. Continuous  Improvement:  This  process  supports  the  principle  of  continuous  improvement, which is a key aspect of NBA accreditation. By regularly assessing and addressing curricular gaps, the program can evolve and better meet the needs of students and industry.

In conclusion, this process provides a systematic, objective, and comprehensive approach to identifying curricular  gaps  as  required  by  NBA  accreditation  criteria  2.1.2.  It  enables  institutions  to  pinpoint specific  areas  for  improvement  in  their  curriculum,  supporting  the  overall  goal  of  enhancing educational quality and student outcomes.

## 2.2.1. Describe  the  Process  followed  to  ensure/improve  quality  of  Teaching Learning (25)

## A. Adherence to Academic calendar (3):

To ensure an effective and disciplined teaching-learning environment, the department follows a three-tier academic calendar system, starting from the University level down to the Department level.

## 1. GTU Calendar:

Gujarat Technological University (GTU) declares the academic calendar before the start of every term. It includes the start and end dates of the semester, tentative exam schedules, internship periods, and official vacation/holiday lists.

## 2. Institute Calendar:

Based on GTU's academic calendar, Government Polytechnic, Gandhinagar prepares its institutional calendar. It incorporates term duration, internal examinations, industrial visits, expert lectures and holidays.

3. Department Calendar -Electronics and Communication Engineering: The department prepares a comprehensive academic calendar aligned with both GTU and  institute  calendars.  It  serves  as  the  backbone  for  planning  and  implementing  all departmental academic and co-curricular activities. It includes:
2. o Term start and end dates for each semester
3. o Class Test schedules
4. o Remedial exam periods and submission timelines
5. o Industrial/site visits, seminars, expert lectures, webinars and co-curricular activities
6. o Parent-teacher meetings and weak student support sessions
7. o Government-declared holidays and Diwali vacation

## Key Attributes of Calendar Adherence:

- o Smooth functioning of the teaching-learning process
- o Clarity of all scheduled events across the campus
- o A structured and well-organized academic environment
- o Avoidance of clashes between various institutional activities
- o Equal  opportunity  for  students  to  participate  in  co-curricular  and  extracurricular activities
- o Fair planning window for faculty to deliver the syllabus effectively

The academic calendar is published on departmental notice boards and through electronic media at the beginning of each term. This layered adherence enhances coordination, discipline, and overall academic quality at the department level.

## 2.2.2 Initiatives to improve the quality of semester tests and assignments (15)

## A.  Process  for  internal  semester  question  paper  setting  and  evaluation  and effective process implementation ( 5 )

Internal assessment for each course is conducted through class tests. The following structured process is followed for question paper setting, evaluation, and implementation to ensure transparency and academic effectiveness:

-  The Head of Department (HOD) appoints a subject in-charge for each course, responsible for setting the class test paper and evaluating student performance.
-  The  subject  in-charge,  in  consultation  with  the  subject  coordinator,  defines  the  syllabus coverage for the class test and informs students in advance.
-  The question paper is designed by the subject in-charge with clear mapping to Course Outcomes (COs). Questions are framed as per Bloom's Taxonomy levels, ensuring inclusion of various cognitive domains (R/U/A) as per suggestion provided by the Departmental IQAC Committee/ Head of Department.
-  The question papers are submitted to the Department GTU Coordinator for smooth conduction of the test.
-  Students  are  briefed  regarding  the  question  paper  format,  evaluation  scheme,  and  syllabus coverage. Seating arrangements and test schedules are displayed on the department notice board and/or digital media.
-  After the test, answer sheets are evaluated by the subject in-charge. Marks and performance are declared as per the scheduled timeline.
-  Result  analysis  is  carried  out  by  the  subject  in-charge  to  identify  slow  learners.  Remedial measures such as counselling and remedial classes are conducted to support their improvement.
-  During  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  same  procedure  was  followed  through  online  platforms, maintaining consistency and academic integrity in internal assessments.

## B. Question paper setting taking into account outcomes / learning levels (5)

For internal assessment through class tests, question paper setting is carried out systematically with a clear focus on Course Outcomes (COs) and student learning levels .

-  The subject in-charge prepares the question paper by mapping each question to the appropriate Course Outcome (CO) and Bloom's Taxonomy level, ensuring coverage of different cognitive domains such as knowledge, comprehension and application.
-  The question paper also reflects the learning level expected from students based on the syllabus and academic progression of the course.
-  Once the paper is prepared, the subject coordinator provides the test paper to the departmental GTU coordinator for the smooth conduct of the class test.
-  During the CO-wise assessment review, the following key aspects are verified for each question paper:
- o Type of exam (Class Test, Remedial Test, etc.)
- o Bloom's Taxonomy level addressed (e.g., Remember, Understand, Apply)
- o Weightage of each CO as per the course assessment scheme

This structured approach ensures that question papers are not only academically sound but also outcome-based and student-centric.

## C. COs covering in Class test / Mid - term tests and assignment ( 5 )

To ensure proper alignment of internal assessments with Course Outcomes (COs) , a structured assessment plan is prepared and implemented for each subject.

-  At the beginning of the semester, the subject in-charge prepares the assessment plan (a part of the lesson plan).
-  The assessment plan clearly outlines the CO-wise mapping for each evaluation method and covers the following elements:
- o Course COs assessment is done by class test/mid test.
-  This  systematic  approach  ensures  continuous  and  outcome-based  evaluation  throughout  the semester.
-  A standard class test format is used across all subjects, as shown in the sample provided below. The format includes:
- o Mapping of each question with the corresponding CO
- o Indication of cognitive level (Remembering / Understanding / Applying, i.e., R/U/A)
- o Marks distribution for each question
- o Structured layout with optional and compulsory sections, ensuring coverage of the entire CO range

This process promotes transparency, uniformity, and enables CO attainment tracking effectively across all subjects and assessments.

## 2.2.4 Quality of Students Projects and Report Writing (35)

-  The  Electronics  &amp;  Communication  Department  at  Government  Polytechnic,  Gandhinagar, affiliated  with  Gujarat  Technological  University  (GTU),  offers  project  work  to  students  in designated  groups  during  the  5th  and  6th  semesters  (Final  Year),  as  per  the  university's curriculum structure.
-  Under the GTU curriculum introduced in September 2012, final-year project work carried a total of 10 credits and was divided into two parts:
- Project-1  ( Course  Code:  3351107 )  in  the  5th  semester  -  4  credits,  with  Internal Evaluation: 60 marks and External Evaluation: 40 marks, Total: 100 marks.
- Project-2  ( Course  Code:  3361109 )  in  the  6th  semester  -  6  credits,  with  Internal Evaluation: 100 marks and External Evaluation: 200 marks, Total: 300 marks.

(GTU Website Reference for Diploma Program - Project: Circular dated 13.08.2012, available at: https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/gtusitecirculars/circulars/12Aug/13082012\_03.pdf )

-  With the implementation of the Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021), the curriculum was restructured  to  introduce  mandatory  summer internships alongside  project  work.  The  summer  internships  aim  to  provide  practical,  industry-focused exposure, guided by AICTE recommendations.
-  As  a  result,  the  allocation  of  credits  and  structure  for  project  courses  was  revised  to accommodate these internships in the final year. With the GTU revised curriculum implemented from  2021,  the  final-year  project  credit  distribution  was  reduced  to  a  total  of  2  credits,  as follows:
- E&amp;C Project-1 ( Course Code: 4351107 )  in  the  5th  semester - 1 credit, with  Internal Evaluation: 50 marks and External Evaluation: 50 marks, Total: 100 marks.
- E&amp;C Project-2 ( Course Code: 4361103 )  in  the  6th  semester - 1 credit, with  Internal Evaluation: 25 marks and External Evaluation: 25 marks, Total: 50 marks.
-  Also,  Since  2021,  GTU's  revised  diploma  curriculum  (COGC-2021),  Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 , includes a 10-mark micro/mini project in the midsemester internal evaluation. These micro/mini, application-oriented projects (14-16 hrs/semester) promote hands-on, competency-based learning, teamwork, documentation, and presentation skills.
-  This  change  is  aligned  with  NEP  2020,  which  emphasizes  experiential  and  industry-linked education, integrating theory with practice.

## A. Projects identification and guide allocation Process

## Project Identification Process:

- Final year diploma projects (typically in Semesters 5 and 6) are based on real-life problems sourced  suggestive  from  industry,  research  organizations,  government  bodies,  or  sociotechnical issues.
- Shodh-Yatra :  Students undertake a "Shodh-Yatra" (problem-finding journey) after the 4th semester  to  identify  project  ideas  from  industry  or  relevant  organizations.  This  scouting  is typically completed before or just after the start of the 5th semester.
- Each  student  or  group  must  submit  their  problem  definition  to  their  department  project coordinator within the prescribed time limit specified by GTU and their allocated faculty guide.
- The  department  project  coordinator  and  assigned  guides  evaluate  the  submitted  problems, correcting and consolidating them as needed before submitting official documentation to GTU in the university-specified format.

## Guide Allocation:

- Each student or group is assigned a faculty guide responsible for reviewing, mentoring, and monitoring project progress throughout the academic year.
- The guide evaluates the problem definition and determines feasibility and relevance.
- An industry mentor may also be involved in guidance and evaluation, especially during final presentations and evaluations.
- The final allocation and confirmation process is managed by the concerned department HOD and communicated as per university guidelines.

## Key Points to be considered:

- Projects must align with a student's chosen electives or branch specialization.
- Regular evaluations and reviews by guides are mandatory, and involvement of industry mentors is encouraged for practical/vocational relevance.
- Strict timelines are set for project identification, title submission, and evaluation stages, usually within the first three weeks of the 5th semester.

## Guidelines for Students

## A. Team Formation

- Team Size: 3 to 4 students per group
- Each group must be assigned to a faculty mentor/ Guide
- Mentor will evaluate progress weekly and maintain a Project Progress Record

## B. Project Selection Guidelines

1. Must address a real-world problem or innovative application.
2. Ideas may originate from:
3.  Industry visits
4.  Faculty suggestions
5.  Student research
6.  Community needs (NGO/MSME/Smart City)
3. Projects should integrate both hardware and software components.
4. Projects with SSIP/startup potential are highly encouraged.

## B. Types and relevance of the projects and their contribution towards attainment of POs and PSOs

- Every EC  diploma project in fifth and sixth semester should be clearly classified (application/product/research/review),  selected  after  evaluating  environment,  safety,  ethical, cost, and standards aspects, and mapped to relevant POs/PSOs.
- Most students opt for UDP (User Defined Projects), and industry mentors provide guidance mainly for selected project titles as per department project guide suggestions.
- Most  projects are UDPs  with  optional  industry mentor  input for title selection and implementation  guidance.  This  structured  approach  aligns  with  both  GTU  curriculum  and Outcome based education requirements for quality assurance and outcome-based education.

## Mapping with Program Outcomes (POs) &amp; Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs)

- Projects must demonstrate contributions to the solution of engineering problems, design and development,  teamwork,  communication,  ethics,  societal/environmental  impact,  life-long learning.
- Also, in line with the application of electronics/communication engineering concepts, tools, and processes for real-world problem solving and innovation.

## C. Process for monitoring and evaluation

## 1. Weekly Monitoring &amp; Progress Reporting

- Each project group meets their assigned faculty guide once every week for structured progress monitoring.
- Guides record observations in a weekly progress report, covering work done, issues faced, corrective actions suggested, and alignment with POs/PSOs.

## 2. Continuous Assessment by Faculty Guide

- Evaluation  includes  technical  progress,  design  quality,  adherence  to  safety,  ethical practices, cost management, and compliance with relevant standards.
- Industry mentors (for selected UDP projects) provide suggestive inputs on title selection and technical improvements when required.

## 3. Individual &amp; Group Performance Tracking

- Contributions  of  each  student  are  tracked  through  the  progress  reports,  interim presentations, and mentor feedback.
- Rubrics  aligned  to  NBA  criteria  assess  problem-solving,  innovation,  teamwork, communication, and ethical/environmental considerations.

## 4. Mid-Term &amp; Final Review

- Mid-term  review  assesses  ~50%  project  completion  status;  corrective  measures  are taken if required.
- Final review and evaluation (internal + external) involve prototype demonstration, vivavoce, and documentation quality check.

## 5. Documentation &amp; Feedback

- All weekly progress reports, rubric sheets, mentor comments, and evaluation summaries are maintained for NBA SAR evidence.
- Feedback is used for improving project execution processes in subsequent batches.

## D. Process to assess individual and team performance

## 1. Individual Assessment

- Each  student's  contribution  is  tracked  through  weekly  progress  reports  and  guide observations during meetings and presentations.
- Peer  feedback  and  individual viva sessions evaluate understanding, skills,  and communication.

## 2. Team Evaluation

- Overall project progress, collaboration, and quality of outcomes are assessed by faculty guides and external examiners.
- Industry mentors provide input on team coordination and practical implementation for relevant projects.

## 3. Assessment Methods

- Structured  rubrics  aligned  with  NBA  criteria  cover  technical  content,  teamwork, innovation, ethics, and environmental aspects.
- Both ongoing monitoring and final evaluations are used to gauge performance.

## 4. Feedback and Improvement

- Timely feedback is shared with students and teams to promote learning, accountability, and teamwork enhancement.
- This streamlined process ensures fair and effective evaluation of both individuals and teams while  meeting  NBA  accreditation  standards  and  supporting  our  department  and  university guidelines.

The following competencies broadly needs to be developed in students :

- 1) Co-creation &amp; Interpersonal abilities
- 2) Analysis Test and Troubleshooting skills
- 3) Programming/ simulation/ debugging skills
- 4) PCB fabrication/ soldering skills/ modeling skill
- 5) Documentation &amp; Presentation skill

## E. Quality of completed projects/working prototypes

- Completed  projects  and  working  prototypes  are  evaluated  rigorously  for  functionality, innovation, and adherence to project objectives.
- Quality parameters include reliability, robustness, safety, ethical considerations, costeffectiveness, and compliance with relevant standards.
- Projects  are  expected  to  demonstrate  practical  applicability  and  relevance  to  real-world problems, especially in line with UDP guidelines and industry input where applicable.
- Documentation  quality-including  design  specifications,  test  results,  and  user  manuals-is reviewed to ensure completeness and clarity.
- Final assessment involves faculty guides and external examiners who verify prototype working condition, effectiveness, and the student's understanding during demonstration and viva.
- The  evaluation  results  are  mapped  with  Program  Outcomes  (POs)  and  Program  Specific Outcomes (PSOs) as evidence for NBA accreditation.

## F. Papers published /Awards received by projects etc

## Student Startup and Innovation Policy (SSIP) Funding support

## Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes

## 3.1 Establish the correlation between the courses and the POs &amp; PSOs (20)

The Program Outcomes (POs) are the skills and competencies which student should have after completion  of  the  program.  The  Program  Outcomes  (POs)  are  specified  by  National  Board  of Accreditation (NBA) for all diploma courses all over the nation.

The Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) are the statements that defines outcomes of a program which make students realize the fact that the knowledge and techniques learnt in this course has direct implication for his/her professional life. The Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) have been proposed after taking consideration of various stake holders like students, alumni, society, industry persons and parents. Afterwards, PSOs were discussed and approved in meeting of faculty members of the Electronics and Communication Department IQAC Committee.

The POs and PSOs of Diploma Electronics and Communication Program are listed below.

## 3.1.1 Course Outcomes  (05)

Course outcomes for Diploma in Electronics and Communication is developed by the faculties of Diploma Electronics and Communication department of Government Polytechnic, Gandhinagar. In EC department we use to have a policy to make a specific faculty as a subject in-charge before the beginning of the semester, and that faculty have to make a COs for that subject and should be endorsed by IQAC committee as well. This activity has been taken every time if and when need.

Course Title, course code and course ID for each semester have been listed through Tables B.3.1.1. course ID format is : C111 [C-for course, 1-Year of course (1/2/3), 1-Semester of course (1/2/3/4/5/6), -1 - course number for respective semester (1/2/3/4/5/6).

## 3.1.2 CO-PO matrices of courses selected in 3.1.1 (5)

## Course Articulation Matrix

Course Articulation Matrix (CAM) means, the degree of each CO of the course is in line with PO. Course Articulation Matrix for Diploma in Electronics and Communication affiliated to GTU is developed by the faculties of Diploma Electronics and Communication department of Government Polytechnic, Gandhinagar. In EC department we use to have a policy to make a specific faculty as a subject in-charge before the beginning of the semester, and that faculty have to make a COs for that subject and should be endorsed by IQAC committee as well. This activity has been taken every time if and when need.

Moreover, the new syllabus which was introduced by the GTU from year 2021 for such subjects same way at department level we have assign a task by subject in-charge. Before starting of every semester, the task has been given to the concern faculty to develop CO of the course in line with PO with justification and also make a CO-PO-PSO mapping with proper justification.

The Course Articulation Matrix for one subject from each semester is presented through Tables B.3.1.15  -  B.3.1.20.  The  last  row  of  each  below  tables  of  course  articulation  matrix  indicates mapping of course with POs /PSOs for the batch of 2020 to 2023. Note:

1. Enter correlation levels 1, 2 or 3 as defined below:

- 1: Slight (Low) 2: Moderate (Medium) 3: Substantial (High)

If there is no correlation, put '-'

## 3.1.3. Program level Course PO/PSO matrix of all courses INCLUDING first year courses (10)

There are some competencies that students must possess to be an outstanding Diploma Electronics and  Communication  professional  for  development  of  the  industry,  academics  and  society.  The competencies  are  reflected  into  Program  Outcomes.  The  curriculums  are  designed  so  that  the required professional abilities can be developed.

The basic science courses are developed to transmit engineering knowledge in respective domains. Such courses are strongly mapped to attain PO1. These courses also contribute slightly / moderately /  substantially  to  impart  ability  for  problem  analysis  and  ability  to  design/develop  solutions. Looking at the course contents and the extent it helps to attain respective POs, i.e. PO1, PO2, PO3, the courses are mapped substantially-3, moderately-2 and slightly-1.

The courses in higher semesters help them to investigate complex problems at working in industry (PO3) and make them aware towards societal and environmental problems (PO5), which in turn sensitize the students to find out environmentally sustainable solutions. The extents these courses help to attain respective POs, i.e. PO3, PO5, the courses are mapped slightly/moderately/substantially.

PSO1 statement shows that a Diploma Electronics and Communication professional works as a team member to solve well defined problems using programming skills. PSO2 statement shows that it helps society by utilizing basic network &amp; software. All the courses offered by the department also  contribute  to  achieve  Program  Specific  Outcomes.  Hence  all  the  courses  are  also  mapped accordingly (PSO1/PSO2). Moreover, many subjects help the students to work as a professional or as an entrepreneur by applying principles and management practices slightly / moderately / strongly and hence they are mapped accordingly.

After deliberation in  the  committee  consisting  of  senior  faculty  members  and  respective  course coordinators, the Program Articulation Matrix and Course Articulation Matrix are prepared.

## Program Articulation Matrix

The program articulation matrix indicates the extent each course helps to attain program outcomes.

Program level Course PO matrix of all courses is reported as Table B.3.1.27. for the batch of 20202023

## 3.2 Attainment of Course Outcomes (40)

## 3.2.1 Describe the assessment processes used to gather the data upon which the evaluation of Course Outcome is based (10)

We are using two methods for calculating attainment of course outcomes of each subject, Direct and Indirect Method. For calculation of final attainment 80% of direct COs attainment and 20% of indirect  COs  attainment  is  considered.  Our  institute  is  affiliated  to  Gujarat  Technological University. So, direct course outcomes attainment calculated based on the university scheme. There are four major (Maximum) components defined by the University for evaluating the performance of the students as shown in figure 3.2.1. Course exit survey form filled by student for indirect course outcomes attainment.

(Fig 3.2.1: Structure and weightage for CO attainment)

The various assessment components and processes used to gather the data for the evaluation of Course  Outcomes  by  direct  method  are  described  as  follows.  The  maximum  marks  and  the weightage of each assessment component in the final grade are also summarized in the Table 3.2.1.1

Step 2: Fix the Criteria for CO attainment Level.

At  the  end  of  each  course,  the  CO  attainment  is  evaluated  for  all  curriculum  components.  The attainment  level  is  set  by  the  Course  Coordinator  with  the  reference  of  previous  results.  The attainment is made by the institution or the program for analyzing the students' knowledge. For setting up the attainment level, our department has used the following method. Attainment level is taken as given below as considering student percentage fixed and varying the marks.

(Table 3.2.1.3 CO attainment levels)

|   CO Attainment  Level | 1 st  and 2 nd  Year                       | 3 rd  Year                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|                      3 | 50% of students score more than 60%  marks | 50% of students score more  than 70% marks |
|                      2 | 50% of students score more than 50%  marks | 50% of students score more  than 60% marks |
|                      1 | 50% of students score more than 40%  marks | 50% of students score more  than 50% marks |

At the end of each course CO attainment is evaluated for all courses. For setting up the attainment level our department has used the following method.

| For First  and  Second- Year  Courses   | 2020 Entry Batch   | 2020 Entry Batch   | 2021 Entry Batch   | 2021 Entry Batch   | 2022 Entry Batch   | 2022 Entry Batch   |

Percentage weightage marks obtained by each student is calculated. Student wise CO attainment calculation  criteria  is  given  in  table  3.2.5.  As  per  that  table  student  216230311002  obtained 65.57% in C243.1, so attainment level in C243.1 is 3. Same as 216230311003 obtained 43.83% in C243.1, so attainment level in C243.1 is 1.

## Step 6: Consolidate all COs of a course by direct method.

For each student CO wise attainment calculated. After that we make one summary sheet of all CO Attainment as shown in figure 3.2.6. From that, average value of each CO is considered as direct CO attainment for final attainment calculation.

Course Exit Survey:

A course exit survey is conducted via hard copy for students who have completed the particular course. The Course outcome relevant questionnaires are asked in Course Exit Survey to evaluate the  contribution  of  Course  to  attain  POs  and  PSOs.  Course  exit  survey  also  helps  the  Course Coordinator to take further corrective actions to improve. Sample of Digital Communication Course exit survey is shown in below figure:

Step 8: Determine the overall attainment level of the course.

80 % weightage is given to direct assessment and 20 % to indirect assessment for overall

CO

Calculation.

For Example:

Direct Attainment Value of C243.1 = 2

Indirect Attainment Value of C243.1 = 2.50

Overall Attainment level of C243.1 = (2 x 0.8) + (2.50 x 0.2) = 2.10

Final overall attainment level of each COs for Digital Communication is calculated as shown in table 3.2.1.4.

## 3.3 Attainment of Program Outcomes &amp; Program Specific Outcomes (40)

Program Outcomes (POs) represent the knowledge, skills and attitudes the students should have at the end of a three year diploma program in India.

Program  Specific  Outcomes  are  statements  that  describe  what  the  graduates  of  a  specific engineering program should be able to do.

## 3.3.1. Describe assessment tools and processes used for assessing the attainment

## of each POs and PSOs as mentioned in Annexure 1 (10)

(Fig. 3.3.1.1 Structure for POs &amp; PSOs Attainment)

![Image](SAR EC Final GPGN_artifacts/image_000130_2810264bd1b9e4db314035d63f3bffda7f78adfa5ce8f38d687dfa7ac974aaaa.png)

The  assessment  tools  and  processes  used  for  measuring  the  attainment  of  each  of  the  Program Outcomes  and  Program  Specific  Outcomes  consist  of  direct  and  indirect  attainment.  For  direct attainment process of POs consists of two tools i.e. direct assessment tool and indirect assessment tool for COs. The direct assessment tool consists of Internal and External assessment of the student as mentioned in above figure. The indirect assessment of COs is carried out by course exit survey.

## Direct POs &amp; PSOs Attainment:

Each COs of a particular course is mapped with the POs and PSOs with attainment level 1, 2, and 3. The value of particular COs attainment and COs POs PSOs mapping is used to derive the attainment of particular POs and PSOs using the below equation.

𝑃𝑂𝑠 &amp; 𝑃𝑆𝑂 𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 =

3

Likewise, attainment of all POs and PSOs with respect to all COs are derived and tabulated in COsPOs-PSOs attainment matrix.

The last row of COs-POs-PSOs attainment matrix indicates weighted average of all COs attainment for particular POs and PSOs, which in turns, represents POs and PSOs attainment for a particular course. A sample COs-POs-PSOs attainment matrix is given below. It represents the contribution of the respective course in direct attainment of POs and PSOs.

## Overall attainment of POs and PSOs:

The overall attainment for each POs and PSOs is derived as per weightage of direct and indirect assessment. To measure the attainment of POs and PSOs, direct assessment has 80% weightage and indirect assessment has 20% weightage. Following illustrative table gives an insight of evaluating the weightage of direct and indirect attainment in measuring overall attainment of POs and PSOs.

## 5.1 Student Faculty Ratio (SFR)(25)

S:F ratio = N/F; F = No. of faculty = (a + b) for every assessment year

- a: Faculty of the specific program/ department considering fractional load
- b: Faculty serving this program from other Program / department considering fractional load
- c: Faculty of this program serving other program/ department considering fractional load

## Note: Fractional load calculation

1.  Faculty  taking  physics  course  is  having  50%  of  allocated  load  of  first  year  civil engineering  students,  25%  load  of  first  year  mechanical  engineering  and  25%  load  of electrical engineering  then  the  fractional load contribution  will be 0.50 for civil engineering, 0.25 each for mechanical and electrical engineering.
2.  Similarly  fractional  load  to  be  calculated  for  inter  department/program  work  load distribution.

## Regular Faculty means:

-  Minimum  75%  should  be  Regular/  full  time  faculty  and  the  remaining  shall  be Contractual Faculty as per AICTE norms and standards.
-  The  contractual  faculty  (doing  away  with  the  terminology  of  visiting/adjunct  faculty, whatsoever) who have taught for 2 consecutive semesters in the corresponding academic year on  full  time  basis  shall  be  considered  for  the  purpose  of  calculation  in  the  Student  Faculty Ratio.

N=No. of students = Sanctioned Intake + Actually admitted lateral entry students

Marks to be given proportionally from a maximum of 25 to a minimum of 10 for average SFR  between  25:1  to  30:1,  and  zero  for  average  SFR  higher  than  30:1.  Marks distribution is given as below:

&lt; = 25 - 25 Marks

&lt; = 26 - 22 Marks

&lt; = 27 - 20 Marks

&lt; = 28 - 15 Marks

&lt; = 29 - 12 Marks

&lt; = 30 - 10 Marks

&gt; 30 -   0 Marks
